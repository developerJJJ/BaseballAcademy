# Baseball Academy Operations Platform

A rule-based operations system designed to automate baseball academy management, ensuring consistent training execution regardless of coach personnel. 

## 🏟️ Project Vision
This is a **vertical ERP for sports academies**. Unlike generic training apps, this system encodes academy operations into a **Rule Engine** that maps athlete classification to automated session generation.

### 🎯 Scope & Composition (Background)
* **Target Audience**: 10 years old ~ High School ~ Adult
* **Frequency Options**: 1x | 2x | 4–5x per week
* **Training Composition**:
    * **Training Drills**: Skill & Conditioning
    * **Workouts**: Strength, Power, Speed, and Recovery
* **Goal**: Enable consistent academy operations without coach decision dependency.

### 📋 Mandatory Classification (Required Inputs)
For 100% automated operations, every athlete MUST be classified by these 3 fields:
1. **Level**: L0 | L1 | L2
2. **Frequency**: 1x | 2x | 4–5x
3. **Group**: Youth | HS | Adult (or Age Bands)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### 2. Installation
Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client-next
npm install
```

### 3. Database Setup
Initialize the SQLite database and seed initial data (Admin, Coach, Athlete, Rules, and Drills).

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run seed
```

### 4. Running the Project
Open two terminals to run both services simultaneously:

**Terminal 1 (Backend - Port 5000):**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend - Port 3000):**
```bash
cd client-next
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Role-Based Workflows

The MVP uses identity headers for simulation. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the landing page, or go directly to the portals:

### 1. Administrator (`/admin`)
- **Profile**: `admin@elite.com`
- **Objective**: Configure the academy rules and oversee metrics.
- **What to check**: View the **Operation Rules** table. This is the "brain" of the system where HS/L1 classifications are mapped to specific session templates.

### 2. Coach (`/coach`)
- **Profile**: `coach1@elite.com` (Simulated via `x-user-id: 2`)
- **Objective**: Execute assigned sessions without making operational decisions.
- **What to check**: See the "Today's Sessions" list. View the specific drill sequence (sets/reps) and the list of assigned athletes for the session.

### 3. Athlete (`/athlete`)
- **Profile**: `athlete1@elite.com` (Bobby Ballplayer, simulated via `x-user-id: 3`)
- **Objective**: View personal training for the day.
- **What to check**: The "My Training" mobile-first view showing the specific drills generated by the Rule Engine based on Bobby's **HS / L1 / 2x-week** classification.

## 📐 Core Classification Model
The system generates all operations based on three required fields for every athlete:
- **Level**: L0 | L1 | L2
- **Frequency**: 1x | 2x | 4–5x per week
- **Group**: Youth | HS | Adult

## 🔒 Security Note
This MVP uses **identity simulation headers** (`x-user-id`, `x-academy-id`) for development ease. For production deployment, these must be replaced with JWT/AuthJS authentication.
